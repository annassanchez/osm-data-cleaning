# Open Street Map Data Cleaning

## Objective

This aim of this project was to retrieve data on a region from [Open Street Map](https://www.openstreetmap.org), audit the data, identify cleaning opportunities, come up with cleaning approaches and run the scripts created to clean the data based on those approaches.

## Region

The region chosen for data cleaning is located on the Southeastern part of Brazil, comprising a sizable part of the state of Minas Gerais and a small part of Rio de Janeiro.
